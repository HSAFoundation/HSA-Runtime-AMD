### AMD Heterogeneous System Architecture HSA - HSA Runtime release for AMD Kaveri & Carrizo APUs

This package includes the user-mode API interfaces and libraries necessary for host applications to launch compute kernels to available HSA kernel agent. This version implements the 1.0 Final HSA Runtime Programmer's Reference Manual and targets AMD Kaveri & Carrizo series APUs on supported platforms. The package is compatible with the 1.6 version of the HSA driver set. See the HSA-docs repository at https://github.com/HSAFoundation/HSA-docs/wiki for more information regarding target platforms, documentation and usage.

#### Installing and configuring the HSA Runtime

Download the HSA-Runtime-AMD from the repository: git clone https://github.com/HSAFoundation/HSA-Runtime-AMD.git

Install the appropriate package for the target operating system. The libraries, header files and samples will be installed in the /opt/hsa directory of the system.

Ubuntu 14.04:

dpkg -i hsa-runtime_1.0.3_amd64.deb

Fedora 21:

Support for Fedora 21 is not provided in this release or in the associated driver release
 
Applications utilizing the HSA runtime must specify how the runtime is utilized, either as an explicitly loaded shared object or a library that is implicitly linked, and the runtime must be installed correctly for the application to appropriately utilize it. Please refer each application's specific documentation regarding runtime installation.

#### HSA Runtime / HSA Driver compatibility

The HSA Runtime interacts with the HSA drivers using an interface library, libhsakmt.so.1. The HSA Runtime is dynamically linked with this library, which must be compatible with both the runtime and the HSA driver to properly work. Any executable that uses the HSA runtime library will require that the directory containing a compatible version of libhsakmt.so is specified in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. The version of libhsakmt.so.1 compatible with this runtime is available in the 1.6 release of the driver set.

#### Running the sample - vector_copy ####

A simple sample, vector_copy, is provided in the samples directory of this repository.To build the sample, simply issue the 'make' command in the sample directory. This will create the vector_copy host executable. 

When executed, vector_copy will load the vector_copy.brig BRIG file, finalize the associated kernel and execute it on an available HSA kernel agent. The libhsa-runtime, libhsa-runtime-ext and libhsakmt shared object library directories must be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

A successful execution will print messages similar to the following:

* Initializing the hsa runtime succeeded.
* Getting a gpu agent succeeded.
* Querying the agent name succeeded.
* The agent name is Spectre.
* Querying the agent maximum queue size succeeded.
* The maximum queue size is 131072.
* Creating the queue succeeded.
* Create the program succeeded.
* Adding the brig module to the program succeeded.
* Query the agents isa succeeded.
* Finalizing the program succeeded.
* Destroying the program succeeded.
* Create the executable succeeded.
* Loading the code object succeeded.
* Freeze the executable succeeded.
* Extract the symbol from the executable succeeded.
* Extracting the symbol from the executable succeeded.
* Extracting the kernarg segment size from the executable succeeded.
* Extracting the group segment size from the executable succeeded.
* Extracting the private segment from the executable succeeded.
* Creating a HSA signal succeeded.
* Registering argument memory for input parameter succeeded.
* Registering argument memory for output parameter succeeded.
* Finding a kernarg memory region succeeded.
* Allocating kernel argument memory buffer succeeded.
* Dispatching the kernel succeeded.
* Passed validation.
* Destroying the signal succeeded.
* Destroying the executable succeeded.
* Destroying the code object succeeded.
* Destroying the queue succeeded.
* Shutting down the runtime succeeded.

An unsuccessful execution will indicate the step that failed.

#### Q & A
1. **I keep getting an error saying *'error while loading shared libraries: libhsakmt.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory'*?**
  * The libhsakmt.so.1 library directory isn't in the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH or the version of libhsamkt.so.1 is incorrect.

2. **I can initialize the runtime, using hsa\_init, but there is no GPU device?**
  * The /dev/kfd device is not properly initialized or it has the wrong permissions assigned to it. The command 'ls -l /dev/kfd' will list the permission on the kfd device. The device /dev/kfd should exist and have 0666 permissions assigned to it. Consult the HSA driver documentation for information on how to configure the kfd device.

3. **The kernels that I create using CLOC version 0.7.5 don't work with this runtime. Why is that?**
  * The 0.7.5 version of CLOC generates 1.0 Provisional HSAIL, which is incompatible with the 1.0 Final version of the runtime. CLOC and other HSAIL related tools will need to be updated to the final HSAIL specification before they are compatible.

#### Unimplemented functionality

* alloca
* scall
* debugtrap
* Indirect calls
* Exception operations; exceptions do not occur. HSAIL operations (enablebreakexceptions, enabledetectexceptions, cleardetectexcept getdetectexcept, setdetectexcept) are not implemented.
* f16 operations on Kaveri hardware
* Flat private
* The following queries are not implemented:
 * hsa_code_symbol_get_info: HSA_CODE_SYMBOL_INFO_INDIRECT_FUNCTION_CALL_CONVENTION
 * hsa_executable_symbol_get_info: HSA_EXECUTABLE_SYMBOL_INFO_INDIRECT_FUNCTION_OBJECT, HSA_EXECUTABLE_SYMBOL_INFO_INDIRECT_FUNCTION_CALL_CONVENTION

#### Known Issues

* Max total coarse grain region limit is 8GB.
* hsa_agent_get_exception_policies is not implemented.
* Image import/export/copy/fill only support image created with memory from host accessible region.
* hsa_system_get_extension_table is not implemented for HSA_EXTENSION_AMD_PROFILER.
* hsa_ext_program_finalize has the following restrictions:
 * Control directives provided in a hsa_ext_program_finalize call are ignored.
* Queue changes (additions or deletions) in any HSA process while dispatches are running can result in premature termination of running dispatches.
